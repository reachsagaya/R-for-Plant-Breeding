# How to Use the Source Codes and Run the Pipeline


The steps to use the source codes and run it on local computer is given below:

- Open the GitHub page containing the source codes and files by using clicking the link [https://github.com/whussain2/R-for-Plant-Breeding](https://github.com/whussain2/R-for-Plant-Breeding).
- This will pop-up the Github repository, click on the **Code** button on right side of page highlighted as green box and scroll and click on **Download Zip**.
- Save and unzip the downloaded repository in local drive.
- Set **GWAS_in_R** as your working directory in R  
- Open the ***.Rmd*** file in R Studio and make sure to change the working directory based on users defined path to the repository.
